Playable Hatate for Touhou Kaeidzuka ~ 
Phantasmagoria of Flower View by Clb184
========================================

This mod is just a re-skin for Aya A to "play" as Hatate Himekaidou.
All the sprites were taken from Double Spoiler and are property of ZUN.


v1.0 (15/03/2021)
=================

First version of this mod, when i was starting with all those things...
Used sprites from Double Spoiler and edited some of them to put into the
game.

- Replaced Aya B sprites with Aya A ones.
- Replaced Aya and Hatate Spell Card background with the ones they use in DS.

v1.1 (24/05/2021)
=================

Now that my knowledge about ANM scripts has increased, i'm polishing
some things, so the animations won't look weird.

- Re-made the Spell Card Background.
- Changed some movement scripts for Hatate sprites.
- Added attack animations for Hatate in Boss sprites.
