Seihou Yuka for Touhou Kaeidzuka ~ 
Phantasmagoria of Flower View by Clb184 and WilliamDavi
=======================================================

This mod is just a re-skin for Yuka B to "play" as her Kioh Gyoku version.
All the sprites were taken from Seihou Kioh Gyoku and are property of Amusement Makers.
Thanks to WilliamDavi for decompiling Yuka's sprites.

v1.0 (09/07/2021)
=================
I need to know how to separate the animations for both, PoFV and KG...

- Changed Yuka B sprites (Boss and Player) with her Kioh Gyoku ones.
- Changed ECL to use the animations (Would look weird with original TH09 sprites).
